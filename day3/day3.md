## ðŸ§± Schema Recap

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    salary INT,
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);
INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name) VALUES
(1, 'HR'),
(2, 'IT'),
(3, 'Sales'),
(4, 'Marketing'),
(5, 'Support');

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, salary, department_id) VALUES
(101, 'Alice', 60000, 2),
(102, 'Bob', 45000, 1),
(103, 'Charlie', 52000, 3),
(104, 'David', 70000, 2),
(105, 'Eva', 30000, 4),
(106, 'Frank', 55000, 1),
(107, 'Grace', 75000, 2),
(108, 'Helen', 40000, 3),
(109, 'Ian', 47000, 4),

2. Get employees in **'Sales'** or **'Support'** departments.

3. Get employees whose **name starts with 'A'** or **ends with 'n'**.
